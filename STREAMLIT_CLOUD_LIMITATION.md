# Streamlit Cloud Limitation - Online Retraining NOT Supported

## ⚠️ Critical Information

**Online model retraining is NOT compatible with Streamlit Cloud.**

This is a **fundamental platform limitation**, not a bug in the code.

---

## The Problem

### Error Observed:
```
RuntimeError: Tried to instantiate class '__path__._path', but it does not exist!
Ensure that it is registered via torch::class_

Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

### Root Cause:
1. **PyTorch + Streamlit Conflict**: PyTorch's RL training uses multiprocessing and low-level operations
2. **File Watcher Issue**: Streamlit Cloud's file watcher tries to inspect torch.classes module
3. **Asyncio Incompatibility**: `model.learn()` creates conflicting event loops
4. **Segmentation Fault**: Process crashes at C++ level when RL training starts

### Why Optimizations Don't Work:
We tried:
- ✅ Reducing training timesteps (1000 → 500 → 200)
- ✅ Aggressive memory cleanup (garbage collection, PyTorch cache clearing)
- ✅ Proper environment cleanup
- ✅ Error handling and recovery
- ✅ Lazy torch import

**Result**: All optimizations failed. The crash still occurs because the issue is at the platform/architecture level.

## ✅ SOLUTION: Offline Retraining Workflow

This is the **ONLY stable approach** for Streamlit Cloud.

### Step 1: Deploy with Data Collection Only
- App automatically saves all patient data to `test_records.csv`
- ENABLE_RETRAINING remains `false` (default)
- 100% stable, zero crashes
- Every 5 entries: Notification about data collection

### Step 2: Collect Clinical Trial Data
- Use the app normally for your trial
- Patient symptoms and test results are saved automatically
- Download data periodically (weekly/monthly)
- Navigate to "Test Result & Download Data" → "Download as CSV"

### Step 3: Retrain Model Offline (Local Machine)
When you have sufficient data (20-50+ samples):

```bash
# On your local computer (NOT Streamlit Cloud)
cd Integated_Malaria_Case_Prediction_v2
python retrain_offline.py --data test_records.csv
```

Or follow the detailed guide in `RETRAINING_GUIDE.md`

### Step 4: Deploy Updated Model
```bash
# Copy retrained model to models directory
cp models/ppo_malaria_retrained_*.zip models/ppo_malaria.zip

# Commit and push to GitHub
git add models/ppo_malaria.zip
git commit -m "Updated model with new clinical trial data"
git push

# Streamlit Cloud auto-deploys the updated model
```

## Current Configuration (STABLE)

### Default Settings:
- `ENABLE_RETRAINING = False` (disabled)
- Status banner: "✅ Stable mode - Data collection enabled. Model retraining available offline."
- No crashes, no segmentation faults
- All features work perfectly

### What Works:
- ✅ Symptom input
- ✅ Prediction using existing model
- ✅ Test result entry
- ✅ Data collection and storage
- ✅ Download CSV/TSV
- ✅ Summary statistics
- ✅ Date/Patient filtering

### What Doesn't Work on Streamlit Cloud:
- ❌ Online retraining (`model.learn()`)
- ❌ Enabling `ENABLE_RETRAINING=true`

### What Works on Local Development:
- ✅ Everything (including online retraining)

## For Your Clinical Trial

### Recommended Schedule:

**Week 1-2**: Collect initial data
- Deploy app to Streamlit Cloud
- Enroll patients and collect data
- Download CSV at end of Week 2

**Week 3**: First model update
- Download `test_records.csv` (should have 20-50+ entries)
- Retrain model on local machine
- Deploy updated model to Streamlit Cloud

**Ongoing**: Regular updates
- Download data monthly
- Retrain with accumulated data
- Deploy improved model
- Model continuously improves with real-world data

### Benefits of This Approach:
1. **Stability**: Zero crashes, reliable for clinical use
2. **Control**: You decide when to retrain (after reviewing data quality)
3. **Quality**: Can filter/clean data before retraining
4. **Testing**: Test retrained model locally before deployment
5. **Compliance**: Audit trail of model versions via Git

## Technical Details

### Platform Comparison:

| Feature | Streamlit Cloud | Local Machine |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| App Hosting | ✅ Free & Easy | ❌ Complex |
| Predictions | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| Data Collection | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| Online Retraining | ❌ Crashes | ✅ Works |
| Resource Limits | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Flexible |

### Why Streamlit Cloud is Still the Best Choice:
- Free hosting for clinical trials
- Automatic SSL/HTTPS
- Easy sharing via URL
- Auto-deployment from GitHub
- Professional appearance
- **Just use offline retraining!**

## FAQ

### Q: Can we fix the torch.classes error?
**A**: No. This is a Streamlit Cloud platform limitation, not fixable in application code.

### Q: Will Streamlit fix this?
**A**: Unknown. This is a known issue with PyTorch/Streamlit integration. No timeline for fix.

### Q: Is offline retraining difficult?
**A**: No! We've provided a complete script (`retrain_offline.py`) and guide (`RETRAINING_GUIDE.md`).

### Q: How often should we retrain?
**A**: 
- Initial: After 20-50 patients
- Ongoing: Monthly or after every 50-100 new patients
- Ad-hoc: When model accuracy drops

### Q: Will the model improve without online retraining?
**A**: Yes! Offline retraining uses the exact same algorithm, just runs on your local machine instead of the cloud.

### Q: Can we use a different cloud platform?
**A**: Potentially, but:
- Would need to set up infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- More complex and costly
- Streamlit Cloud is free and easy
- **Offline retraining is simpler**

## Summary

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| App Deployment | ✅ Working perfectly on Streamlit Cloud |
| Data Collection | ✅ All patient data saved automatically |
| Predictions | ✅ Model makes predictions correctly |
| Online Retraining | ❌ NOT supported on Streamlit Cloud |
| Offline Retraining | ✅ Fully supported and documented |
| Clinical Trial Use | ✅ Ready for production use |

---

## Action Items

1. ✅ **Deploy to Streamlit Cloud** with default settings (retraining disabled)
2. ✅ **Use app for clinical trial** - collect patient data
3. ✅ **Download data regularly** - CSV export every 1-2 weeks
4. ✅ **Retrain offline** when you have 20+ patients
5. ✅ **Deploy updated model** via GitHub push
