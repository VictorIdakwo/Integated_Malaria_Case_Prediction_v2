## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
3. Click "New app"
4. Select your repository: `Integated_Malaria_Case_Prediction_v2`
5. Main file path: `Home.py`
6. Click "Deploy"

### 2. Verify Deployment

After deployment, you should see:
- ✅ Green banner: "Running in stable mode - Data collection enabled for clinical trials"
- No crash warnings
- All navigation pages accessible

### 3. Trial Workflow

#### For Healthcare Workers:

**Step 1: Patient Registration**
1. Navigate to "Clinical Malaria Prediction" from sidebar
2. Enter unique Patient ID (e.g., `TRIAL001`)
3. Answer Yes/No for each symptom:
   - Chill/Cold
   - Headache
   - Fever
   - Generalized body pain
   - Abdominal pain
   - Loss of appetite
   - Joint pain
   - Vomiting
   - Nausea
   - Diarrhea
4. Click "Predict Malaria"
5. Record the predicted result

**Step 2: Clinical Testing**
1. Send patient for laboratory malaria test
2. Receive actual test result

**Step 3: Result Entry**
1. Navigate to "Test Result & Download Data"
2. Patient ID and prediction are displayed
3. Select actual clinic test result (Positive/Negative)
4. Click "Submit & Save Test Record"
5. System shows if prediction was correct/incorrect
6. Form resets for next patient

**Step 4: Data Download**
1. View summary statistics (Total, Positive, Negative cases)
2. Filter by:
   - All Data
   - Specific Date
   - Specific Patient ID
3. Download as CSV or TSV format
4. File includes timestamp for archival

## Data Structure

### CSV Columns:
- **Date**: Timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
- **Patient ID**: Unique identifier
- **Symptoms**: Binary array [10 features]
- **Predicted Case**: Model prediction (Positive/Negative)
- **Actual Case**: Lab test result (Positive/Negative)

### Example:
```csv
Date,Patient ID,Symptoms,Predicted Case,Actual Case
2025-10-04 15:30:22,TRIAL001,"[[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]",Positive (1),Positive (1)
2025-10-04 16:15:45,TRIAL002,"[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]",Negative (0),Negative (0)
```

## Best Practices

### Patient ID Format
- Use consistent format: `TRIAL001`, `TRIAL002`, etc.
- Or clinic-specific: `CLINIC_A_001`, `CLINIC_B_001`
- Avoid special characters
- Keep under 20 characters

### Data Collection Schedule
- **Daily**: Download data at end of each day
- **Weekly**: Full dataset backup
- **Monthly**: Comprehensive analysis and reporting

### Data Security
- Patient IDs should be anonymized
- Do not include personally identifiable information (PII)
- Follow HIPAA/GDPR guidelines
- Store downloaded files securely

### Quality Control
- Verify Patient ID before submission
- Double-check clinic test results
- Review accuracy metrics regularly
- Flag any systematic prediction errors

## Monitoring Trial Progress

### Daily Checks:
- [ ] App is accessible
- [ ] New entries are saved
- [ ] Download function works
- [ ] Metrics update correctly

### Weekly Analysis:
- [ ] Total entries count
- [ ] Positive/Negative ratio
- [ ] Prediction accuracy rate
- [ ] Any app errors or crashes

### Monthly Review:
- [ ] Overall trial progress
- [ ] Data quality assessment
- [ ] Model performance trends
- [ ] Consider offline retraining if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: App Shows Red Warning
**Solution**: This is normal if `ENABLE_RETRAINING=true`. Keep it disabled for stability.

### Issue: Data Not Saving
**Solution**: 
- Check internet connection
- Verify Patient ID is entered
- Ensure both symptom input and test result are submitted

### Issue: Download Button Not Working
**Solution**:
- Try different filter options
- Check if data exists for selected date/patient
- Use "All Data" to download everything

### Issue: App Crashed
**Solution**:
- Refresh the page
- Streamlit Cloud auto-restarts
- Data in `test_records.csv` is preserved
- If repeated crashes, verify `ENABLE_RETRAINING=false`

## Support

For technical issues:
1. Check Streamlit Cloud logs
2. Verify model files are present (`models/ppo_malaria.zip`, `models/scaler.pkl`)
3. Review `RETRAINING_GUIDE.md` for offline retraining
4. Contact repository maintainer

## Compliance Notes

- This is a **decision support tool** only
- Not a replacement for clinical diagnosis
- Always confirm with laboratory testing
- Follow local medical protocols
- Maintain patient confidentiality

## Success Metrics

Track these KPIs for your trial:
- **Enrollment Rate**: Patients/day
- **Completion Rate**: Test results entered/predictions made
- **Accuracy Rate**: Correct predictions/total predictions
- **Data Quality**: Missing fields, duplicate IDs
- **System Uptime**: App availability %
